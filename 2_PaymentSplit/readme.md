## Overview 🎯
The **PaymentSplit** contract enables automatic distribution of ALPH payments among multiple recipients based on predefined shares. This implementation ensures transparent, secure, and efficient payment splitting through a robust smart contract system.

## Contract Features 🚀

### **Constructor Initialization**
- Configures payment distribution through **payee addresses** and their corresponding **share values**.
- **Validation**: Ensures arrays have matching lengths and non-zero payees.
- **Share System**: Initializes and stores distribution percentages for all payees.
- **Setup**: Integrates payees into the contract's payment infrastructure.

### **Payment Reception**
- Automatically handles incoming **ALPH** payments to the contract.
- **Tracking**: Records all received payments in the contract state.
- **Event Emission**: Logs payment receipts for transparency.
- **Delayed Distribution**: Stores payments for later distribution rather than immediate splitting.

### **Release Mechanism**
- Enables withdrawal of accumulated payments for eligible payees.
- **Share Calculation**: Computes exact payment amounts based on predefined shares.
- **Balance Management**: Updates released amount tracking.
- **Transfer**: Sends ALPH directly to payee addresses.
- **Event Logging**: Records all payment releases for auditing.

### **Releasable Amount Calculation**
- Provides real-time calculation of pending payments for any address.
- **Share-based Computation**: Factors in individual share percentages.
- **Balance Tracking**: Considers total received funds versus released amounts.
- **Withdrawal Limit**: Returns maximum available withdrawal amount.
